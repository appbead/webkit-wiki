# QtWebKit Reloaded

This is a project aiming to upgrade QtWebKit to modern WebKit code base.

## Why?



## System requirements

The next configurations are going to be supported:

* OS: Linux (X11 and EGLFS)
* CPU architectures: x86_64, MIPS
* Compiler: g++ >= 4.8
* Qt >= 5.4 (right now 5.2 will probably be enough)

Please write to webkit-qt@lists.webkit.org mailing list in case you are willing to help us to support different platforms. In particular, the next platforms would be nice to have:
* OS X (>= 10.10)
* Windows (>= 7) without WebKit 2 API
* Linux on 32-bit x86 (just needs testing) and other CPU architectures (amount of needed work will vary a lot)
* Android (?)
* Other POSIX-compliant operating systems like *BSD
