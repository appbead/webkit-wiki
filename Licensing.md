We use the same licensing policy as [WebKit project](https://webkit.org/licensing-webkit/), so all contributed code must be under either BSD or LGPL 2 license. 

This allows us to 

* submit any fixes and improvements made to generic WebKit code to webkit.org later when they are deemed to be useful for other ports;
* freely exchange local improvements with other downstream ports of WebKit
* upstream whole or part of Qt port's code to webkit.org in case we have more manpower
