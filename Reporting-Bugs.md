### Bugs (e.g., incorrect page rendering, crashes)
Before reporting bug here please check following things:
* (Obviously) Check if our bug tracker already contains similar report(s).
* Is this bug present in QtWebKit from Qt Project? If so, please report it to [Qt bug tracker](https://bugreports.qt.io). See http://wiki.qt.io/ReportingBugsInQt for more info.
    * Note that though Qt 5.6 does not officially include QtWebKit, there's 5.6 branch in QtWebKit repository which contains some fixes over 5.5.1
* 

### Feature requests
Sorry, but we don't accept feature requests at this stage (yet). You may [[ask us|Home#contacts]] if some feature has chances to be implemented, but it is still unclear when it can happen.

If you want to contribute patches implementing new features and/or Qt APIs, at this point it is recommended to develop them on top of QtWebKit branch maintained by Qt project and sumbit them to Gerrit. Please [[contact us|Home#contacts]] if you have any questions.
