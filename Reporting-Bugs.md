### Bugs (e.g., incorrect page rendering, crashes)
Before reporting bug here please check following things:
* (Obviously) Check if our bug tracker already contains similar report(s).
* Is this bug present in QtWebKit from Qt Project? If so, please report it to [Qt bug tracker](https://bugreports.qt.io) if it was not already reported. See http://wiki.qt.io/ReportingBugsInQt for more info.
    * Note that though Qt 5.6 does not officially include QtWebKit, there's 5.6 branch in QtWebKit repository which contains some fixes over 5.5.1
* Was this bug previously reported to Qt Project and fixed? If so, include a link to the Qt bug in your report.

You can also search for patches which can fix your bug in history of
* QtWebKit repository maintained by Qt Project
* qt-5x2 branch here
and include links to these patches in your report. 

Note that many fixes and improvements done after departure of Qt port from WebKit trunk were not merged back yet, it would save a lot of time if you helped us to identify these patches and integrate them.

### Feature requests
Sorry, but we don't accept feature requests at this stage (yet). You may [[ask us|Home#contacts]] if some feature has chances to be implemented, but it is still unclear when it can happen.

If you want to contribute patches implementing new features and/or Qt APIs, at this point it is recommended to develop them on top of QtWebKit branch maintained by Qt project and sumbit them to Gerrit. Please [[contact us|Home#contacts]] if you have any questions.
